Arctic lakes' seasonal fluctuations are essentially unquantified aside from a handful of specific sites. This is a significant knowledge gap because the role of seasonality in observed interannual lake area trends is unknown, the magnitude of intra-annual lake variability may be more significant than long-term changes, and the timing of lake fluctuations has important implications for habitat, carbon cycling, and exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere.

In this project, we documented the open water lake area during the 2016-2023 ice free seasons across the entire Arctic north of 60 degrees, at near-daily frequency. The analysis of these results are ongoing, so the results presented here are just *teasers* for the time being. More to come...
