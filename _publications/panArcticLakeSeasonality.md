Arctic lakes expand and contract over daily to interannual timescales, reflecting and enhancing broad-scale Arctic environmental changes such as amplified warming, the intensifying hydrologic cycle, thawing permafrost, and the regional carbon balance. Numerous studies have examined decadal-scale lake area trends to better understand changes in permafrost conditions, the regional water balance, and ecological structure and function; however, seasonal (intra-annual) lake area changes remain poorly understood due to lack of observations in the Arctic.

Disentangling lake area seasonality is critical to accurately measuring long-term lake area trends. Additionally, high-latitude ecological processes can be just as sensitivie to the timing of freshwater fluxes as their magnitudes. In this project, I documented the open water lake area during the 2016-2023 ice free seasons across the entire Arctic north of 60 degrees, at near-daily frequency. The analysis of these results are ongoing, so the results presented here are just *teasers* for the time being. More to come...

How do recent changes in snowmelt timing influence interannual lake area variability?
