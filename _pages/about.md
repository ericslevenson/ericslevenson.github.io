I am a geographer, which -- as Hal Mooney suggested -- means that I am, "concerned with the changing spatial organization and material character of Earth's surface." My long-term aim is to...
Towards that end, I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Oregon where I am fully funded by NASA to utilize satellite-based observations to improve our representation and understanding of the hydrologic cycle. 


 My interest in water spans scales ranging from the hydraulic structure of a single eddy to the global water balance; however, my research and funding to this point have focused on regional-scale surface water change across the Arctic. Surface water is a wonderful material to consider geographically because of how much spatial variations in surface water patterns reveal about The Arctic, too, is an ideal target for geographic questions -- Where? Why there? and So What? -- xxx...framed geographically, changing faster, 

On one hand, understanding and predicting changes to the spatial distribution of surface water requires that we embrace how a variety of human and physical processes interact, and on the other hand spatial variations in surface water's patterns can reveal insights for other topics of interest (e.g., climate change, urbanization, conflict, and risk). 

 My contributions to  hydrology and geomorphology are based on improving our representations surface water's patterns and behavior, which enables better estimates of carbon fluxes, improved model calibration, and better predictions of future surface water change. 
and on a day-to-day basis I am usually developing and applying geospatial data science techniques such as satellite remote sensing, applied machine learning, algorithm development to process very large volumes of geospatial data, and Structure from Motion surveys.
Although my research and funding to this point has focused on *regional scale* surface water patterns across the Arctic, I am also interested in the hydrology of specific *places* such as an individual watersheds, lakes, or river channels.

, which has led me to specialize in the scientific disciplines of hydrology and geomorphology using geospatial data science tools such as satellite remote sensing, applied machine learning, and algorithm development to process very large volumes of geospatial data in cloud environments.




prone to ask the following questions: Where? Why there? and So What? My research and teaching express the following geographic thoughts: that spatial variations are revealing, that location and place are useful tools to see how seemingly separate processes interact, and that geographical representations  our descriptions of events and . My long-term aim as a scientist and educator is to improve our understanding of -- and relationship to -- water's movement across the landscape. 

My research primarily focuses on using satellites to measure surface water in the Arctic and track its changes through time. My motivation for this work is that 'in-situ' gauges that can monitor the volume of water flowing through rivers, or evaporating from lakes, are expensive and sparsely distributed in the Arctic. This is unfortunate because Arctic surface water 

My motivation stems from our societal dependence on information about the amount of water stored or moving through lakes and rivers for managing water utilities, planning for flood risks, rehabilitating ecosystems, and creating tourism and recreational opportunities. Unfortunately, the 'in-situ' gauges that produce vital water monitoring are expensive and sparsely distributed. Therefore, my goal is to fill the water information gap using satellite data.
