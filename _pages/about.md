I am a geographer, which -- as Hal Mooney suggested -- means that I am, "concerned with the changing spatial organization and material character of Earth's surface."  My long-term aim is to improve our understanding, predictions, and adaptations to water's changing storage and movement throughout the landscape. Towards this end, I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Oregon where I am fully funded by NASA to utilize satellite-based observations to improve our representation and understanding of the hydrologic cycle. 


<span style="font-size:0.82em;">*"Who would not choose to follow the sound of running waters? ...I can lean on the rail of a little bridge over a brook and contemplate its currents, its whirlpools, and its steady flow for as long as you like; with no sense or fear of that other flowing within and about me, that swift gliding away of time." -Thomas Mann* </span>

More specifically, I'm concerned with water's storage and movement throughout the landscape, which simultaneously supports and threatens thriving human (and natural) communities.My interest in water spans scales ranging from the hydraulic structure of a single eddy to the global water balance; however, my research and funding to this point have focused on regional-scale surface water change across the Arctic. Surface water is a wonderful material to consider geographically because spatial variations in surface water patterns can reveal valuable insights into related processes such as regional climate, permafrost thaw, economic development, energy production, and vegetation dynamics (to name a few). The Arctic, too, is an ideal target for the classic geographic questions -- Where? Why there? and So What? -- because the climate and landscape in the northern latitudes is changing much faster than the rest of the globe. The thawing Arctic stokes fears of irreversible climate feedbacks with global consequences (e.g., carbon release from permafrost thaw), as well as hope for brand new investment opportunities in tourism, new shipping routes, and resource extraction.


**Take from research...
...On a day-to-day basis I am always learning and creating new techniques to convert the pedabytes of satellite and other Earth observation data into digestible insights into surface water behavior. Through this effort, I could be called a geospatial developer, machine learning engineer/AI researcher,  remote sensing and cloud-computing engineer, statistician, cartogapher, and of course, writer. 


I'll stop rambling about Arctic hydrology, and I promise not to get into the regional geomorphology (but, the thaw slumps!). Instead, it's worth mentioning how I really spend my time: remote sensing and geospatial data science -- or is it satellite-based Earth observation and machine learning? Computer vision and cloud computing for 'big data' analysis? Geospatial dataset engineering? Or algorithm development for image and time series processing? Wait, is this all just statistics? No..it's all just AI!
  * Sorry about that...there are many words I can use to market my skills. In reality I'm always learning and creating new techniques to convert the pedabytes of satellite and other Earth observation data into digestible insights into surface water behavior, which usually takes the form of new maps, visualizations, or statements.
