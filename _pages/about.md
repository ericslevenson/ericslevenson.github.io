I am a geographer, which -- as Hal Mooney suggested -- means that I am, "concerned with the changing spatial organization and material character of Earth's surface."  Currently, I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Oregon where I am fully funded by NASA to utilize satellite-based observations to improve our representation and understanding of the water cycle. I work with my advisor Sarah Cooley and her [research group](https://sites.duke.edu/coollab/) at Duke University's Divison of Earth and Climate Sciences at the Nicholas School of the Environment.

<span style="font-size:0.82em;"> *"Who would not choose to follow the sound of running waters? ...I can lean on the rail of a little bridge over a brook and contemplate its currents, its whirlpools, and its steady flow for as long as you like; with no sense or fear of that other flowing within and about me, that swift gliding away of time." -Thomas Mann* </span>
