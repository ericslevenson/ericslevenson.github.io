<span style="font-size:0.78em;">*"Who would not choose to follow the sound of running waters? ...I can lean on the rail of a little bridge over a brook and contemplate its currents, its whirlpools, and its steady flow for as long as you like; with no sense or fear of that other flowing within and about me, that swift gliding away of time." -Thomas Mann* </span>

I am a geographer, which -- as Hal Mooney suggested -- means that I am, "concerned with the changing spatial organization and material character of Earth's surface." Water is a wonderful material to think with as a geographer, because describing its spatial organization requires an integrated understanding of human and physical processes. My interest in water spans scales ranging from a single eddy to entire regions, which has led me to specialize in the scientific disciplines of hydrology and geomorphology using geospatial data science tools such as satellite remote sensing, applied machine learning, and algorithm development to process very large volumes of geospatial data in cloud environments.

Currently, I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Oregon where I am fully funded by NASA through their Early Career Research Program. Although my research and funding to this point has focused on regional scale surface water patterns across the Arctic, I am also interested in the hydrology of specific *places* such as an individual watersheds, lakes, or river channels.


prone to ask the following questions: Where? Why there? and So What? My research and teaching express the following geographic thoughts: that spatial variations are revealing, that location and place are useful tools to see how seemingly separate processes interact, and that geographical representations  our descriptions of events and . My long-term aim as a scientist and educator is to improve our understanding of -- and relationship to -- water's movement across the landscape. 

As Hal Mooney stated, a geographer is concerned with the changing spatial organization and material character of Earth's surface.

My research primarily focuses on using satellites to measure surface water in the Arctic and track its changes through time. My motivation for this work is that 'in-situ' gauges that can monitor the volume of water flowing through rivers, or evaporating from lakes, are expensive and sparsely distributed in the Arctic. This is unfortunate because Arctic surface water 

My motivation stems from our societal dependence on information about the amount of water stored or moving through lakes and rivers for managing water utilities, planning for flood risks, rehabilitating ecosystems, and creating tourism and recreational opportunities. Unfortunately, the 'in-situ' gauges that produce vital water monitoring are expensive and sparsely distributed. Therefore, my goal is to fill the water information gap using satellite data.
