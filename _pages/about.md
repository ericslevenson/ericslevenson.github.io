I am a geographer, which -- as Hal Mooney suggested -- means that I am, "concerned with the changing spatial organization and material character of Earth's surface." Currently, I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Oregon where I am funded by NASA to utilize satellite data to monitor the water cycle. I work with my advisor Sarah Cooley and her <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/coollab/" target="_blank">research group</a> at Duke University's Division of Earth and Climate Sciences at the Nicholas School of the Environment.</p>

<span style="font-size:1.0em;"><a href="/files/Earth-from-Space.pdf"> The lure to watch Earth from space</a> is strong, for both the beauty and the insight available from a satellite's point of view. </span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size:1.0em;"> Arctic lakes expand and contract throughout a typical summer. This annual reccurrence is dramatic to watch, and changes to the timing or strength of the seasonal pattern would have dramatic consequences for carbon cycling and time-sensitive ecological relationships. This animation shows the progression of lake area anomalies (differences from the average lake area) throughout a typical summer. It is just one example of how satellite-based research can be scientifically while feeling like filming a natural phenomenon -- such as a sunset or flood. Head to the 'research' page to learn about the motivation and methods for mapping near-daily lake area changes in over 75,000 Arctic watersheds using Sentinel-2 imagery. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20bc2516-8ec7-4fb5-8181-07fd8b9e9b1a)

<span style="font-size:1.0em;"> Sometimes, though, it's worth ditching the satellites and taking a closer look at things.</span>
