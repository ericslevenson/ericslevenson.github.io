I am a geographer, which -- as Hal Mooney suggested -- means that I am, "concerned with the changing spatial organization and material character of Earth's surface."  Currently, I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Oregon where I am fully funded by NASA to utilize satellite-based observations to improve our representation and understanding of the water cycle. I work with my advisor Sarah Cooley and her [research group](https://sites.duke.edu/coollab/) at Duke University's Divison of Earth and Climate Sciences at the Nicholas School of the Environment.

  <br/><br/><span style="font-size:1.0em;">Given the beauty and unique scientific value provided by the satellite's-eye point of view, the lure to watch Earth from space is strong. Here's an example...watch below as Arctic lakes expand and contract throughout a typical summer. I call this the 'pulse' of the Arctic since it repeats every year, like a hearbeat. For maximum enjoyment, I recommend taking it all in for a cycle or two, and then focus on specific locations as the animation progresses.

<p align="justify"><span style="font-size:0.85em;"> Both animations show the seasonal progression of lake area anomalies (differences from average lake area).The animation on the left highlights the timing of lake fluctuations regardless of the magnitude of lake area change, whereas the animation on the left shows where lakes are most seasonally variable. Quite a bit of data, computing power, and legwork goes into mapping the daily extent of lakes in over 75,000 Arctic watersheds, and you can read more about this specific project on the 'research' page.</span>

<span style="font-size:0.82em;"> "Who would not choose to follow the sound of running waters? ...I can lean on the rail of a little bridge over a brook and contemplate its currents, its whirlpools, and its steady flow for as long as you like; with no sense or fear of that other flowing within and about me, that swift gliding away of time." -Thomas Mann <br/> 
*In other words, sometimes it's worth ditching the satellites and getting up close.*
