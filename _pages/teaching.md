Although this website highlights my research activity, most of my professional experience and many of my career goals are centered on education. I consider teaching to be one of scientists' most important responsibilities in shaping a positive future for our communities. My teaching experience began while leading outdoor leadership courses throughout college. While romping across Alaska and Switzerland with a crew of students in the earliest stages of my career life, I found teaching to be a serious but joyful craft.

My classroom teaching experience ranges from middle school to undergraduate students:
* The Sage School, Hailey, Idaho. 6th and 7th Grade Math and Science; High School Math
* Maine Coast Semester: Math Teaching Fellow
* University of Oregon Geography Department TA: Courses include Geographic Data Science; Hydrology; Fluvial Geomorphology; The World and Big Data; Mapping with Drones; Intro to Physical Geography

For any educator, I'd highly recommend that reading The Sage School's mission, vision, and philosophy. I joined the faculty in the school's 6th year and played an active role in designing curriculum and school programs. The faculty and students at Sage have strongly shaped my approach to teaching and curriculum design: [The Sage School](https://thesageschool.org/). This is one of the few schools that I believe 'walks the walk' when it comes to living their mission to offer a student-centered experience, providing an active and engaging curriculum as well as genuine connections between students and teachers. 

Much of my teaching experience has been outside of the classroom as well:
* Instructor for Rios to Rivers Paddle Tribal Waters
* Trip Leader for Overland Summers
* Whitewater Kayaking Coach for Jackson Hole Kayak Club
