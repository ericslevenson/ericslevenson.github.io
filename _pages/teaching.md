The majority of my teaching experience was at The Sage School in Hailey, Idaho where I was the science and math teacher for 6th and 7th grade, and the pre-calculus teacher for high schoolers. For educators interested in progressive education, I'd highly recommend reading their mission, vision, and philosophy, which has strongly shaped my approach to teaching and curriculum design: [The Sage School](https://thesageschool.org/)
